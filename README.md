---

### 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy

---

### 💻 Usage
Run the program to solve the N-Queens problem:
```bash
python n_queens_ga.py
```

Follow the prompts to:
1. Set the board size (e.g., `N = 8` for an 8x8 chessboard).
2. Choose Genetic Algorithm parameters (mutation rate, population size, etc.).

Output:
- Prints the solved board in a matrix format.

### 🔧 Algorithm Overview
- **Selection:** Chooses the fittest individuals based on a fitness function that minimizes conflicts.
- **Crossover:** Combines parent solutions to produce offspring.
- **Mutation:** Introduces randomness to explore diverse solutions.
- **Fitness Evaluation:** Calculates the number of conflicts for each solution and prioritizes the least conflicting ones.

### 🔬 Technical Implementation
**Key Functions:**
- **Initialization:**
  ```python
  def initialize_population(size, n):
      return [random_permutation(n) for _ in range(size)]
  ```
- **Fitness Function:**
  Evaluates the number of queens attacking each other.
  ```python
  def calculate_fitness(board):
      # Counts row, column, and diagonal conflicts
  ```
- **Crossover and Mutation:**
  Introduces variety and combines solutions to find optimal configurations.
